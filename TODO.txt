Changes for future releases:
-----------------------------

* add word-word similarities (in addition to the document-document already in gensim)
* add GUI (web browser-based) to distributed computing -- manage active nodes, status, node load, failures, etc.
  * or better yet, integrate some **sane** higher-level framework for distrib. comp., don't re-invent the wheel
* more extensive unit testing
