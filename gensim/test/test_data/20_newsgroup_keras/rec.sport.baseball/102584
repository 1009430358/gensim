There's a lot of whining about how much players are overpaid.
I thought I'd put together an underpaid team that could win a pennant.
I splurged and let four of the players earn as much as half a million dollars; the highest-paid player is Frank Thomas, at $900K.
I cut some players, like Kenny Lofton, Chris Hoiles, Keith Mitchell, Tim Wakefield, and a bunch of pitchers, all of whom could have arguably made the team better at a cost of $1 million for the lot of them.
The total team salary is $7,781,500, averaging slightly over $300K a player.
If that's too steep, you can dump Thomas and Bagwell, replacing them with Paul Sorrento and a minimum wager to save a bit over a million dollars, and still have one of the best teams in the majors.
