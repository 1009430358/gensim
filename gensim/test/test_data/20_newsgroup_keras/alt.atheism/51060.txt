An Introduction to Atheism
This article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism.
Whilst I have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.
I would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some relevant books are listed in a companion article.
To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.
All the questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped up repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.
Some other frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.
Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions posed from a Christian viewpoint.
This is because the FAQ files reflect questions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians who proselytize on alt.atheism.
So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as Christianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine being.
Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it may not.
"What is atheism?"
Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.
Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.
The former is often referred to as the "weak atheist" position, and the latter as "strong atheism".
It is important to note the difference between these two positions.
"Weak atheism" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.
"Strong atheism" is a positive belief that God does not exist.
Please do not fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are "strong atheists".
Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their atheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making flat-out denials.
"But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?"
Definitely not.
Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe it to be true.
Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to believing that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or not.
Which brings us to agnosticism.
"What is agnosticism then?" The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1876.
He defined an agnostic as someone who disclaimed ("strong") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things must be some cause unknown and unknowable.
Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for sure whether God exists.
