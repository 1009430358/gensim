Books  Fiction
"The Santa Claus Compromise"
Short story.  The ultimate proof that Santa exists.  All characters and events are fictitious.  Any similarity to living or dead gods -- uh, well...
"A Canticle for Leibowitz"
One gem in this post atomic doomsday novel is the monks who spent their lives copying blueprints from "Saint Leibowitz", filling the sheets of paper with ink and leaving white lines and letters.
EDGAR PANGBORN
Post atomic doomsday novel set in clerical states.  The church, for example, forbids that anyone "produce, describe or use any substance containing... atoms".
PHILIP K. DICK
Philip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short stories and novels.
His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.
He wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than technology.
Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he remained sceptical.
Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:
"Galactic Pot-Healer"
A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.
When the deity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is unable to comply.
A polished, ironic and amusing novel.
"A Maze of Death"
Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.
"VALIS"
The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of unknown but possibly divine origin.
He is accompanied by his dogmatic and dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.
"The Divine Invasion"
God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from another star system.
Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.
MARGARET ATWOOD
"The Handmaid's Tale"
A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously assassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it
"right" again.
The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live under the new Christian theocracy.
Women's right to own property is revoked, and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the radio is only used for readings from the Bible.
Crimes are punished retroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the "old world" are hunted down and hanged.
Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to at first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.
VARIOUS AUTHORS
"The Bible"
This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.
However, it is probably worth reading, if only so that you'll know what all the fuss is about.
It exists in many different versions, so make sure you get the one true version.
